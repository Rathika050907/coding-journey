ðŸš¨ Problem Statement
Rotate an array of size n to the left by d positions.

Example:
Input:  arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], d = 2  
Output: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
âœ… Approach 1: Juggling Algorithm
Concept: Use the GCD of n and d to identify the number of sets.

Process:

Compute gcd(n, d)

For each cycle, shift elements by d positions.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

âœ… Approach 2: Reversal Algorithm
Concept: Reverse parts of the array in three steps.

Steps:

Reverse the first d elements.

Reverse the remaining n - d elements.

Reverse the entire array.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
